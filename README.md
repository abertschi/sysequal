> Launch Android's builtin Equalizer

<img src="./assets/cover.png" width="900">

Sysequal (as in **Sys**tem **Equal**izer) is a small utility
application which launches Android's builtin Equalizer. Most flavors of Android
come with a decent Audio Equalizer builtin. The Equalizer is, however, not
always accessible system wide and limited to an per-application
basis. This app starts the Equalizer if available and restores
settings after a reboot.

## FAQ
**Why doesn't it work?**  
Make sure you have no additional equalizers installed. If Sysequal
fails to load the Equalizer an error will show up in the app.
